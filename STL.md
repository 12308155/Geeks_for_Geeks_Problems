STL is a collection of pre build classes and functions that make it easy to manage data using common data structures like vectors, maps, stacks etc.

it saves time and efforts by providing ready to use efficient algorithms and containers

Containers are data structures used to store objects and data 

vectors Deque List and Array 



queue stack (containers adapters)

set multiset map multimap(associative containers)

unordered set and unordered map and unordered multiset and unordered multimap(unordered Associative containers)



vector: it is a dynamic array; 

The time complexity of sorting an array is O(n log n)



a vector represents dynamic sized array that automatically grown when elements are added beyond current capacity.







**vectors** in java are thread safe and array list is not but both have same functionality.
